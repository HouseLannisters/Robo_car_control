# Robo_car_control

   In the project a mobile application controlled (via bluetooth) robot car was designed.
Components used
- Arduino uno microcntroller
- HC-05 Bluetooth module
- L293D Motor Driver IC
- 12V DC Motor
- Android phone(as remote)
- Essentials-> gripy wheels, batteries & wires

       Once the basic stucture of the robo car is done, the necessary connections to the DC motors are given from the board via IC motor driver such that the acion of each motor is controlled for the given command. 
       A mobile application was deigned using MIT App Inventor 2 which acts the controller of the robo car. Using the Bluetooth module the mobile app and the robo car is connected, then it moves as per the command given. For each command the motor actions are altered to move in the given direction.
